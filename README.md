# Sports-Registration-
The application I developed is a client/server terminal-based sport registration system for individuals who would like to participate in organized sports at the campus athletic recreation centre. The system asks the user/client to first submit their student number and checks if it is a valid number and must be 9 digits. After individuals submit their student number a list of sports offered is sent to the client and client chooses which sport, they would like to join. The sport chosen is then stored into a CSV file and is sent back to the server - so the server is able to keep track of how many people chose which sport. 

The Client/Server application was developed using Java Sockets (TCP Sockets) and consists of multi-threaded client and server.
